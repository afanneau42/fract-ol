# **Fract'ol**
#### *It's the second project in the graphic branch.*

The subject asks to code a **C** program wich can **display** a **representation of a fractal** and allow the user to **interact with it**.

We are allowed to use the **minilibx library** to manipulate a window and drow in it.
The main difficulties are to **find mathematical expressions** and **optimize it**.
